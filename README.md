## What is a story?

The _acceptance criteria_ is a description of a feature that must be implemented to complete the story. In our case, it is described like this: _user must be able to open an app, enter the name of the task, press enter and see his task in the list of tasks._ <br>

User story is used to write the very first integration test. Based on the integration test, we write the unit tests. After the unit tests are written and fail, we begin writing code to fix the unit tests. Once all unit tests are fixed, the integration test should also pass.

## Writing integration tests

Writing integration tests is actually pretty simple. You should just read off the acceptance criteria (or any English description of the feature), and translate it into JavaScript. To do this, you will need to know a few Selenium functions: <br>

- `driver.get(url)`: Open a webpage.
- `driver.wait(condition, timeout)`: Wait for something. Itâ€™s typically used to wait for elements while the page is loading.
- `driver.findElement/driver.findElements`: Find elements on a webpage. <br>

And a few helper functions:

- `By`: This function is used as an argument to find elements. For example:
- `By.id("textInput")`
- `By.className("wrapper")`
- `By.xpath("//input")`
- `driver.findElement(By.tag("div"))`
- `until`: - This function is used as an argument for the wait function. For example:
- `until.elementLocated(By.id("submitBtn"))`
- `until.titleContains("abacaba")`
- `wait(until.elementLocated(By.name("wrapper")), 1000)`

## XPath Cheetsheet

- ### Selecting a tag:

  - `//h1`: Select all H1 elements.
  - `//article//p`: Select all `p` elements within `article` elements.

- ### Ordering:

  - `//ul/li[1]`: Select first LI child of UI elements.
  - `//a[last()]`: Slect the last A element of the whole document.

- ### Attributes:

  - `//*[@id='input']`: Select element with id='input'.
  - `//div[@class='wrapper']`: Select all DIV with class wrapper.

## Jest Cheetsheet

- # Defining tests

  - Grouping tests: `describe('<Component />', () => {});`

  - Individual tests: `it('does something', () => {});` or `test('does something', () => {});`

- # Setup and teardown

  - `beforeEach(() => {})`: Runs before each test.

  - `afterEach(() => {})`: Runs after all tests.

  - `beforeAll(() => {})`: Runs once before all tests.

  - `afterAll(() => {})`: Runs once after all tests.

- # Assertions
`expect(value)` is always the first step to assert something. It contains the following functions:

- `expect(value).toBe(value)`: Shallow equality check
- `expect(value).toEqual(value)`: Deep equality check
- `expect(value).toBeTruthy()` and `expect(value).toBeFalsy()`
- `expect(value).toBeDefined()`
- `expect(value).toBeNull()`
- `expect(value).toBeGreaterThan(value)`, `expect(value).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(value)`, `expect(value).toBeLessThan(value)`, and `expect(value).toBeLessThanOrEqual(value)`
- `expect(value).toBeCloseTo(value, numDigits)`
- `expect(value).toMatch(regex)`: Check a string against a regex.
- `expect(value).toContain(value)`: Check a data structure for containing a value.
- `expect(value).toBeInstanceOf(type)`: Instance check
<br>
You can also add `.not` to expect to flip the assertion around: `expect(value).not.toEqual('abacaba')` and `expect(value).not.toBeInstanceOf(Abacaba)`

- # Defining tests
  - Create a mock function: `jest.fn()`.
  - Check if a mock function was called: `expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalled()` and `expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(args)`
